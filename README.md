# Kool-Story
Kool and HiZ Gang have been working on some new beatz, but they are afraid someone will steal their lyrics before they have a chance to lay down their new tracks.
They said they would be communicating at 34.217.107.134 on port 31000 but there does not seem to be anything there. 
Can you intercept their lyrics or is their disco funk secure?
